# Auxiliary lemmas on Schwartz functions and supports

Small general-purpose facts used when a Schwartz test function is required to avoid a point, or
when a linear rescaling of the frequency variable has to be recognized as a Schwartz-space
endomorphism.

## Main results

* `coe_iterate_schwartz_derivCLM`: iterating `SchwartzMap.derivCLM` computes `iteratedDeriv`.
* `iteratedDeriv_eq_zero_of_tsupport_subset_compl`: all derivatives of a Schwartz function
  supported away from a point vanish at that point.
* `exists_pos_le_abs_of_tsupport_subset`: a function supported away from the origin is
  uniformly separated from it.
* `MeasureTheory.integrable_mul_of_bound_on_tsupport`: multiplying an integrable function by a
  factor bounded on its support preserves integrability.
* `hasTemperateGrowth_const_mul`, `antilipschitzWith_const_mul`: the scaling `ζ ↦ c ζ` is of
  temperate growth and, for `c ≠ 0`, antilipschitz — the hypotheses of
  `SchwartzMap.compCLMOfAntilipschitz`.

All statements are Mathlib-only and are upstream candidates.
